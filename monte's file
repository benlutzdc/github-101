## Hello, world!
My name is Monte and my favorite animal is probably the tiger. To be honest, I don't really think about favorite animals that often.


## My Thoughts on Government
My favorite government agency is the CFPB because it's innovative.

An agency that I find really cool is DARPA. Google it. It's cool.
